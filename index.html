            <span id="content">Seba Construction, a major developer in Victoria, BC, approached our studio for a complete rebranding of their company. We rose to the challenge and designed a sleek, modern brand that reflected their commitment to quality, innovation, and community. We created a variety of construction based signage and brand collateral designs that seamlessly captured the essence of Seba Construction, a family owned operation. When it came to their website, we placed greater emphasis on refinement and developed a fully animated experience with a smart user interface. The entire platform is based on a custom WordPress CMS tailored to their exact needs; exhibiting their work in the most optimal way.</span>

            <span id="content2">In searching for a provider for their new law firm rebrand and website redesign, Charles Law was drawn to FOE by consistently demonstrating our ability to differentiate clients in other categories. As a boutique legal company committed to impacting social change, the partners wanted to step well outside the perception that one law firm is much like any other. Conveying the Charles Law approach called for putting an emphasis on collaboration and scalability in a team with strong and unique individual talents.</span>

            <span id="content3">Our team of creatives recently had the privilege of collaborating with Discovery Coffee to create new packaging design for their cold brew, and a robust brand expansion. To maximize their visual impact, we used innovative designs to expand on their iconography and library of patterns to strengthen their identity in the marketplace. The packaging design is eye-catching, unique, and totally tailored to Discovery Coffee’s style — an ideal combination that sets them apart from the competition and cements their presence as a true leader in their industry.</span>
